### Some of Famous Javascript Questions along with it's answer:

Q.1-List some of the popular features of ES6?
-->Some of the popular features of ES6 are:

- ES6 supports immutable variables
- The addition of arrow functions in ES6.
- Block scope assistance for variables and functions
- Enhanced OOPs properties
- Promises
- Template literals
- Modules
- Multiline Strings
- Classes
- Managing extended parameters
- ES6 braces Map/Set along with WeakMap/WeakSet
- Default parameters
- Destructuring assignment

Q.2- Why is Babel used?
-->Web Browsers do not understand ES5 and hence use a JavaScript transpiler, Babel, to convert modern JavaScript, also known as ES6, into browser-compatible ES5, which is embraced by all browsers.

Q.3-Briefly explain promises in ES6.
--> JavaScript supports Asynchronous programming with the help of promises. While running the tasks independently from the main thread in asynchronous programming, promises are created which are either fulfilled or rejected based on an outcome. Before promises were introduced, callbacks were used to deal with asynchronous functions. But then, the anomaly of callback hell led to the introduction of promises in ES6.

Q.4-Name the data types supported by JavaScript.
-->JavaScript supports seven data types:

    1. Number
    2. Boolean
    3. String
    4. undefined
    5. null
    6. Object
    7. Symbol

Q.5-What is an arrow function?
-->Arrow functions are a concise way of defining a function. The arrow function uses a fat arrow indicator.

    ```
    function subs(a, b){
    return a-b;
    }
    Using arrow function
    const subs = (a, b) => a-b;

    ```

Q.6-Differentiate among let, const, and var.
-->
    
    let
    -A let variable has a block scope.
    -The values of a let variable can be reassigned.
    -The let variable can be declared even without initialization.
    
    const
    -A const variable has a block scope.
    -Const variable has restricted mutability.
    -Initialization of the const variable is necessary for a const variable.
    
    var
    -A var variable has a functional scope.
	-The values of a var variable are mutable.
    -Initialization is not required while declaring a var variable.

Q.7-Which OOPs feature is supported in ES6?
-->ES6 comes with class-based OOPs property. It supports static methods, which instead of being bound to an instance of a class, actually belong to the class itself. ES6 also supports the inheritance property of Object-Oriented Programming by which a child class can inherit the properties of a parent class. The keywords super and extends used to implement inheritance.

Q.8-Mention the three states of promises in ES6.
-->Promises in ES6 come with three states:

    1. Pending: The initial state of a promise when it is neither fulfilled nor rejected is called the pending state.
    
    2. Rejected: This states that the promised action was unsuccessful.
    
    3. Resolved: This state marks the fulfillment of the promised operation and that it was a success.

Q.9-Briefly explain the Temporal Dead Zone.
-->The let keyword is not used for variable hoisting in ES6. Thus the declarations do not increment at the topmost area of the execution context. ES6 gives a reference error whenever a variable is referenced without initializing it. Therefore the period between the variable binding and declaration in a program is known as the Temporal dead zone.

Q.10- Explain callback hell.
-->Callback hell comes into application while developing applications on the web. While writing thousands of lines of code, developers often find it tedious to manage the callback and hence use a nested callback to make their jobs easier. Multiple callback nesting is known as callback hell. Sometimes massive callback nesting can make your code messy and clog your application.
